# tradSys
As part of the end of second year project at ENSIAS, my classmates <b>BAHA Khadija</b>, <b>ENNEIYMY Jamal</b> and I, we have chosen to develop an application to predict the evolution of the stock of a given company as an entry, and to help users making decisions about whether to sell or buy products in the future.
We consider two of the most used architectures in the literature, those are: the LSTM and GRU. As an addition, we will try to implement some financial indicators on the data to experience with the data a little.
